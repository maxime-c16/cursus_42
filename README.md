# cursus_42

## Description

This repository contains the projects I have done during my training at 42 Paris.

## Projects

### Libft

The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that I will be allowed to use in all my other projects.

### get_next_line

The aim of this project is to code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.

### ft_printf

The aim of this project is to recode the printf function from the C standard library.
- The prototype of ft_printf is `int ft_printf(const char *, ...);`
- It must not do the buffer management like the real printf
- It must manage the following conversions: `cspdiuxX%`
